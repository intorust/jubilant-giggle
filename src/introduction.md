# Everything you ever wanted to know about Rust...

...but didn't know where to ask.
Rust is designed to be a *flexible* language, one that will let you do just about anything. 
This is a good thing.
But it also means that learning to use Rust means
developing a sense for which features and patterns to use where.
This book is designed to help you "shortcircuit" that process by
collecting expert answers and advice to common questions that come up when building Rust software.
